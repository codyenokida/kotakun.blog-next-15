I've decided to start a blog!!

It's been on my mind since last year to start a blog. I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with a platform more intimate than Instagram or Facebook, but something shareable and public to whoever is interested in my life.

It will be nice to have a place to write, so I can remember moments that make me who I am a little better. I'm hoping to build up this blog to be a time capsule for me in the future :D

I created this website from scratch, from design to code. It was fun to create something without following any tutorial or design.

I'll be posting my day-to-day thoughts, epiphanies, stupid thoughts, observations, travel memories, and life updates here. That's it for now, I'll see you soon!!

どうも！！

ブログを始めることにしました。マミー、パパ！こんにちは。

色々な感想、思い出、旅行話をブログにしたいと思います。この日本語の部分は日本語通訳の練習みたいな感じですけど。。。

このウェブサイトは自分でコードしました。自分の物を一から作るのは楽しい。

とりあえずはこれだけ。また後ほど。😗
