The first game I picked up was all the way back in 2005. On my shiny new Gameboy, I grinded out Pok√©mon Sapphire for hours on end. Wherever I went, my Gameboy went.

The main objective of Pok√©mon Sapphire is to defeat the Elite Four and collect all 202 Pok√©mon. That's the overarching journey, but Pok√©mon players, including myself, enjoyed the different aspects of play that made the game so enthralling. You could enjoy battling, collecting new Pok√©mon, building your squad, or simply have fun exploring the new region map. There was something for any type of gamer to enjoy.

Personally, I was the type of player to be attached to 2 to 3 Pok√©mons. I wasn't interested in amassing the strongest or rarest Pokemon. Instead, I set out to train Pokemons that fit ~my vibe~. My collection included: ones I caught early on, ones that seemed to mirror my personality, or ones that I thought were most troll. I had fun playing the game not through the progression of the main objective, but by focusing on leveling up my rotation and humiliating opponents by defeating them with an unexpected squad.

League of Legends, a multiplayer battle arena game, was also a huge proponent of my high school gaming life. In this game, I also loved playing unconventional champions (Like Bard or AP Varus) and building up my craft to perfect those characters. I loved how the game had many layers, including team composition, skill, and strategy. There was a lot of competition (ranking system) that went alongside it, and I was all for it.

One of the latest games I played was Celeste, a single-player platformer game with buttery mechanics, beautiful artwork, melodic music, and a heartwarming story. I was so encapsulated in the game, I finished the main story plus the B sides (iykyk) in a week although I was working a full-time job at the time.

As I look back at all the games I've played, I've realized how I play, what I play, and how I interact with games have evolved as I matured. Not too long ago, I viewed games purely as an entertainment medium. I judged games by how action-oriented or content-filled they were. I'm not sure when that paradigm shifted in my head (perhaps it was when I met Ken, who introduced me to great indie games); however, now I view and play games completely differently. I now believe that games are a widely misunderstood art form. In terms of immersiveness, imagination, and technical difficulty in executing the idea, games are truly an underappreciated artistic medium that could be explored more. I'd even say a beautifully designed game is the pinnacle of creativity - a masterpiece (superseding films imo).

I now notice all the small details in games. Music suddenly isn't just a background asset but an integral part of the experience (Celeste does this super well). The world you're placed in isn't just a fictional setting but hundreds of hours of someone's creativity poured into getting a message across. It's fun to enjoy all aspects of what game creators have built out for the world. If it's a well-thought-out game, everything (including art, music, and mechanics) has been crafted and delicately placed there for a reason. When you keep that in mind, games become much more enjoyable at every moment.

Perhaps, it was also a slight shift in my life perspective that brought about the changes in my preferences and opinions about games. To look a little more into the nooks and crannies. To explore the smallest of details. To enjoy the intent behind something. Simply put, how you play games reflects how you're navigating life (and vice versa). Whether you're a competitive gamer or a slow-paced adventurer, I'm certain it'll reflect in some facet of your life.

Of course, how I played games in the past is still a vital part of me. Just as I've been playing games like League of Legends or Pokemon all these years, I still love walking the unpaved path, being competitive, and enjoying putting in the work (grinding) when it matters. I interact with games with much more intent and appreciate the effort behind all interactions. That's also true with how I try to live my life today.

If you analyze how you play games, you'll slowly realize that life is also just a game. There are so many ways to enjoy it. There's no right or wrong way to play a game, so just enjoy _your_ process, and hopefully, that will give you peace of mind. üòå
