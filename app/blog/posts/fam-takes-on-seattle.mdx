The Enokidas land in Seattle!

We made a family trip out of our (me, Grant, and Yuri's) Seattle Marathon. Landing in Seattle, it was such good weather!! Seattle is usually cloudy, rainy, and foggy. This weekend had only blue skies, perfect for the weekend and the long-anticipated marathon.

Seattle is a great city!! Especially when it's not foggy 🌫️, it has amazing scenery of the bay and Mt. Rainier. It was cold AF though…

We crossed off all the main spots of Seattle which included: Pikes Place, Klondike National Historic Park, Seattle Aquarium (for an Animal Crossing Event lol), and the Gum Wall, all in one day! Lots of walking but that was a good warmup for the marathon!

This trip was a reminder of the infamous Enokida Energy. We all have weird quirks that make being with family so fun.

The main event, the Seattle Marathon also went so well!! It was amazing to see the city of Seattle on foot. Running through the University of Washington, Green Lake, and the Arboretum was so amazing. Such a pretty city, it has an allure to it that Californian cities don't have. This makes me want to settle down in a city with seasons and lots of trees. All the training I've done also paid off big time! I completed the marathon with 4:14:13!!! I felt I could've paced myself better for an even better time, but I'm so proud of myself for completing such a big accomplishment. I even pooped mid-way! Imagine if I had a stronger bowel and stomach. Maybe I'll come circle to another marathon some other time. For now… The next endeavor awaits!!

This was a great week, with no job on Monday, I could sleep in, and figure out unemployment day by day till I go on my big trip. I will enjoy it as much as I can! XD

Written on the plane back to SF… adios!

Thank you for the good memories Seattle and Fam!!

シアトル到着！！

サンクスギビング、マラソン、家族旅行。色々楽しい思い出ができた週末でした。

シアトルの天気は絶好調。曇りなし。日光満載。ほんとラッキー。シアトルは普通曇りや雨のみ。

マラソンは無事４：１４：１３のタイムで終えました。色々特訓は苦労したが頑張った甲斐があった。また来年も挑戦してみたい。次は４時間切れるかな？

旅行の大話は僕が仕事から解雇された件。マミーからは心配のコメント、パパからは「コウバルジャン」と言うあだ名。。。バンバン聞かされた。まあ、みんなで色々笑って過ごせて嬉しいです。

これからは無職の生活！！

できる限り、存分に楽しみます。また後ほど。😗
