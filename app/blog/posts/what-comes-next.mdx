Happy New Year!!

Before talking about the future, let's reflect on this past year.

2023 was an interesting year, to say the least.

It was my first full year of working as a software engineer. It was also my first time getting laid off as a software engineer. I moved to San Francisco and experienced what city life was like. I went to my first wedding. I ran my first half marathon and full marathon. I tried pottery for the first time. I rock-climbed outdoors for the first time. I went mountain biking for the first time. I climbed Mt. Fuji. I rode a motorcycle for the first time. I got my scuba-diving license. I volunteered at a marine science institute. I played in a city soccer league for the first time. I experienced lots of highs and lows. I cried some but laughed a lot more. I thought frequently about who I was and how I wanted to live.

From these experiences, I learned that I value learning new skills, undertaking new ventures, and becoming knowledgeable in the things that interest me. I hope to find a job where I don't feel stagnant.

Which leads to 2024…

The year is already off to a great start. I had an amazing time with Ashley at Big Bear to end the year off. We watched a bunch of Netflix's Singles Inferno. We had a great time relaxing and got into the New Year well-rested.

We spent some time working on a little “Manifestation Guide” for ourselves. It's awesome to have goals written on a cool sheet of paper. It makes it feel more concrete and lit a fire in me to strive everyday to make my dreams into reality.

Some goals I have:

- Getting better at Mandarin

- Running another marathon??

- Be able to do a muscle-up

- Do 40 squats carrying Ashley

- Film a documentary on something I find interesting

- Read 15 books

- Writing/blogging my thoughts

- Work on a side project or a business

I hope I'll be able to achieve these! :)

However, I'm most excited to experience and learn from random and spontaneous adventures. I'm excited to see how this year unfolds, and I'm ready to tackle each challenge that comes my way.

To start off 2024 is my biking trip!! I'm excited to be free and share all the adventures I have there with Grant.

I hope everyone else has a great year ~~ manifest your future!
