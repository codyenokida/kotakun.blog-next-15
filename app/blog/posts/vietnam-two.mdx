H·ªôi An was one hell of a tourist town that one night was enough for us to want to leave the crowds and search for our next destination. Wanting to leave Central Vietnam a little sooner, we attempt to catch a bus or train to Saigon. We saw that Tam K·ª≥, the small city underneath H·ªôi An, had a train and bus station that could solve our problems. However, we had no luck finding tickets because of T·∫øt, and the next available will be next week. Welp, more biking for us! That's what we came here for anyway. XD We will keep riding south till the tickets are cheaper and available!

Since we're riding coastal routes, the weather and biking atmosphere are great. Well, sort of‚Ä¶ it's still beaming hot and plenty humid. The views, food, and encounters remain astounding. Nonetheless, we keep cycling, and every day feels like a new adventure.

We sometimes spend the night in these random towns that are barely on the map when we can't make it to the bigger cities at the end of our cycling day. 9 times out of 10, these towns have the most immaculate vibes. We see a sliver of ‚Äúreal rural life‚Äù in these towns. One such was Tam Th√°nh. This beach town lies 50m from the beach, stretching across a long side road parallel to the main busy highway. Although the streets are mostly empty at night, small restaurant stalls teem with the laughter and smiles of local families and friends. We hear echoes of karaoke singing across the many houses that line the long street. An additional 3-minute walk from the road is a beautiful sandy beach, void of any resorts or attractions. Tam Th√°nh was a complete paradise of a place that made you feel as if you were transported to Hawaii. It was also Valentine's Day when we arrived. We saw young couples taking slow walks and picnics on the beach late at night. Just what a sight to take in within a small, obscure town in the middle of Vietnam.

Moments like these make me realize how huge the world is. We usually only see cities and natural wonders that are easiest to travel to. Those no doubt have their magical experiences. However, the places that weave those locations together (which are the easiest to pass by) have a uniqueness found nowhere else. If life is like this in a random town in Vietnam, what about other places? Russia? China? Zambia? Colombia? It's even hard to imagine what those could be like since I never had a notion that Vietnam could be like this. I want to visit and experience more ~~ My curiosity explodes. The world is enormous and so fascinating. Ironically, this hugeness makes you also appreciate the smaller, more intimate things in life. Friends, experiences, and the finer things that are happening around you at all times.

Enough rambling, more cycling!!!

The road from Tam K·ª≥ to Quy Nh∆°n was treacherous but rewarding. A lot of hills, heat, and sweat. The surroundings make the journey worth it though. 350 miles DONE! Vietnam is huge. It's almost 1.5x the length of California üò±. We underestimated the distance we would need to cover.

Since our visas will expire in 11 days (writing this on 2/18), we will take the bus to Saigon, and then finish up our Vietnam portion of the trip by crossing the border through the Mekong Delta to Cambodia!

Bye bye!
