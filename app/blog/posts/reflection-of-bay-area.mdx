Today, as I walked through the rugged streets of the Mission District for the last time as a resident, a flurry of thoughts and observations flooded my mind. It is really my final day. I spent 1 year in Mountain View and 5 months in San Francisco. I experienced countless new friendships, viewpoints, hardships, and memories during my time here. I felt first-hand what it is like to live in Silicon Valley, where I encountered arguably the smartest, brightest, and most interesting peoples in the entire world. To constantly have those people around humbled me and challenged the way I viewed the world and broadened my perspective.

Sitting at the top of Mission Dolores Park, looking at the city horizon, I tried envisioning my future here and in other places.

San Francisco is a beautiful city â€” but you can't ignore the heap of problems that also lie within it. From the homeless crisis and drug abuse on the streets to the opposite spectrum of out-of-touch and stuck-up individuals who emphasize money too much. Would I come live here again..? Maybe, maybe not, but it will be a place I will never forget.

What about a bigger city like NYC or Tokyo? The Suburbs? A more rural area?

After daydreaming for a while, I came to the conclusion that the place you live really does not matter (too much). As cliche as it is, the people in your life are the unparalleled proponent that makes somewhere "feel like home".

- To all the C3 guys, you guys made work fun to go to.

- To all three of my roomies, you guys rocked. Sorry for being Satan, Ryan and Julia.

- To all UCI and pbros, thanks for hanging out all the time.

- To the friends that didn't live near me, you guys were always there to rely on.

- To all the new people I've met here, I'm glad we crossed paths.

All of you impacted my stay here and changed the course of my future in one way or another. I hope we all stay in touch.

To Ashley, you make me feel at home wherever we go. Let's keep strengthening our relationship so no matter what adversities hit us, we can come out stronger.

This turned out way more dramatic than it should be, but why not keep it this way.

Adios amigos ~~ to the next one!!
