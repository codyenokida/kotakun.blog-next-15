I'm back in Irvine for the holidays!

I'm spending lots of time with my mom since I won't see her for the next 6 or more months. I do need to get my steps in though, so I walk around the block.

I see many people walking while on my walk. From walking a dog, walking with a spouse, walking with friends, walking while listening to music, walking and talking, walking with your phone, or walking alone. Although it may look the same from the outside, everyone is walking for a different reason.

Although I started my walk to get exercise, my mind started to wander as if it were a bee fluttering from flower to flower in a garden.

Hey, that tree is looking nice. Oh! I see a squirrel. Life is just around everywhere even in a city like Irvine. Wait life… How do I want to spend my life? What about work? Should work simply be work? Oh, I want a house. That's important. And oh what about investing? Why do people invest in real estate or high-growth businesses? Why am I just taking random finance advice? Why not find something that creates more value? What does value mean to people? Oh, there are so many different people in the world. Even people who live in the same city are so different. Am I different from the people around me? How would I be different if I wasn't born here? Would I even have these thoughts if I were that person? … Wait would I even have these thoughts if I didn't go on this walk?

Is this how everyone thinks of when they take a walk? My mind wanders endlessly asking questions and those questions lead to even more questions.

I don't have these thoughts every time I go on a walk, but it's nice to slow down and think about what you want. Doesn't need to be serious -- it could be about something as simple as pasta. Being alone (with no real distraction) is super important in my opinion, and I wish people make a conscious effort to do this.

I listen to a random song at the end of my walk. When the song fits the surroundings and the vibe, it's pretty awesome. On today's walk, Reverend Baron hit hard while the skies above me faded from blue to pink to black. And that's when I had my last thought -- listening to music shlaps.
