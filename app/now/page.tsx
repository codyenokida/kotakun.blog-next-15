          <b>Currently:</b> I'm in Taiwan!!! I'm so excited to be here and see
          what this place has to offer. I've spent the past two weeks with
          Ashley and her relatives. We spent the first half with her father's
          family in Songshan District. We spent the following week going on a 12
          person roadtrip (cousins, aunts, uncles included) down to Kenting
          National Park. Fun family time and was a fun time to meet all the
          folks. Taiwan is hot and humid, but has some amazing food and great
          culture. Career wise, I've been interviewing. I made it pretty far
          into interviews at one place but rejected for not having the right
          amount of experience. It's tough to be a junior in this market. Tough
          luck, but I'm confident in my skills so I'll keep on grinding! 2 more
          weeks in Taiwan and then I'm off to Japan!
